## Render 1.3
- Added: [all] structured buffers
- Fixed: [dx12] static buffer upload resources being created in common state instead of generic read
- Changed: [dx12] default texture layout from 64kb undefined to unknown in dx12
- Added: [all] FrameID to view
- Added: [dx12] UAV barriers for structured buffers
- Fixed: [dx12] an issue allocating large buffers on dx12
- Added: [all] debug names to back buffer textures
- Added: [dx12] mesh and amplification shaders
- Added: [dx12] function to reload PSOs
- Fixed: [all] samplers by default being clamped to mip 0.
- Began: [dx12] Raytracing implementation, but future work will continue on an RT branch.
- Added: [all] shader visibility for root signatures in dx12 and samplers in dx11.

## Render 1.2
- Added: [all] RenderPtr type which is a smart pointer style struct for render types.
- Added: [all] pipeline hashing.

## Render 1.1
- Added: Support for multiple viewports, mainly for ImGui docking branch. This includes a new option to sync backbuffer flips after the present call, or to delay the sync until the next viewport frame.
         It is more efficient to sync at the start of a frame when you know you will be processing command lists for other viewports as the backbuffer will be more likely to become available before then.
- Added: RenderTypes.h now includes forwards for all render types so you don't need to include "Render.h" in your headers.
- Added: GraphicsPipelineTargetDesc structure to capture the render pass state for a PSO.
- Added: ShaderMacro constructor that accepts a uint
- Added: REVISIT D3D12 textures now flush the upload queue on create so that batch creating textures doesnt saturate memory with processed upload buffers. A proper async loading strategy is needed to handle this correctly

- Updated: The project layout so that it works better as a drop in lib. Public code now sits in the top level and private within the 'Private' folder.

- Fixed: An issue where setting an INVALID PSO would cause a nullptr crash. In the event we set an invalid PSO now the command list early outs.
- Fixed: D3D12 requires both dxil.dll and dxcompiler.dll to operate, but the D3D12 makefile would only copy the former.
- Fixed: D3D12 dynamic buffers InFlight check always returning false causing active buffers to be rewritten while in use.
- Fixed: D3D12 static buffer pages were not allocated in fixed positions in the page array, meaning that reallocations of the pages array invalidated internal iterator handles for tracking allocations.
- Fixed: D3D12 static buffer allocation strategy incorrectly calculating the remaining size of a block when doing a partial alloc.
- Fixed: D3D12 CommandList::DrawIndexedInstanced was passing numIndices into the numInstances slot causing horrendous draw calls.
